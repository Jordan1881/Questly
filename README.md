# Questly

> **Turn your daily tasks into epic quests.**
> A gamified task management app that connects to Jira and transforms your work into an RPG-style experience — earn XP, unlock rewards, and track your progress.

---

## Overview

Questly bridges the gap between productivity and motivation. By connecting to your Jira workspace, it pulls your assigned tickets and presents them as quests with XP rewards based on difficulty. Complete tasks, level up, and redeem your earned XP for real-world coupons in the Reward Shop.

This project was built as a final-year Information Systems capstone project.

## UI Screenshots

### Hero Page
![Hero Page](<UI Screenshots/hero page screenshot.png>)

The landing page greets users with the Questly brand and a clear value proposition. A soft purple animated gradient background with floating blob animations creates an immersive first impression. The headline — *"Turn your daily tasks into epic quests"* — immediately communicates the app's gamified concept, with CTA buttons to sign in or get started.

### Task List
![Task List](<UI Screenshots/task list screenshot.png>)

The Task List page displays all Jira-synced tasks as interactive quest cards. Each task shows:
- **Difficulty badge** (Easy / Medium / Hard) with color-coded borders
- **Jira ticket ID** for traceability
- **Task title and description**
- **Due date** with high-priority flags
- **XP reward** (+20 / +40 / +70 XP based on difficulty)

A filter bar at the top lets users slice tasks by status (All, Completed, High Priority) and difficulty. A live **March 2026 calendar** on the right highlights task due dates and completion status at a glance. A Jira sync status badge confirms the last sync time.

### Profile
![Profile](<UI Screenshots/profile screenshot.png>)

The Profile page gives users a full picture of their progress and account:
- **Profile hero card** — avatar, name, email, Level 3 badge, and a Dashboard-style XP progress bar (650 / 1000 XP) with tick markers and a glowing fill
- **Available XP badge** — shows spendable XP (1,250) that carries over from the Reward Shop
- **XP History chart** — an interactive SVG line chart showing XP earned over the last 7 days, with hover tooltips and a smooth Catmull-Rom curve
- **Account Details** — Jira integration status, total tasks completed, total XP earned, and member-since date
- **My Rewards** — a grid of coupons redeemed in the Reward Shop, updated in real time as purchases are made
